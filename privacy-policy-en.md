# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** August 31, 2025

## 1. Introduction

At NutriSnap ("application", "we", "our"), we take your privacy very seriously. This policy explains how our app processes data and outlines our core privacy principle: any personal nutrition data you enter is stored **only on your device** and remains under your control.

## 2. What Information Do We Process?

We categorize the information processed by our app into two groups:

### 2.1 User-Entered Data Stored Only on Your Device

The following types of information are provided by you to use the app’s features and are **never sent to our servers** or accessed by us:

* **Meal Records:** Notes about foods you eat, such as names, calories, and macro values.
* **Photos:** Food photos you provide to the AI recognition feature. These photos are analyzed and then remain only on your device.
* **Barcode Data:** Scanned barcodes to retrieve product information.
* **Water Intake Records:** Your daily water consumption.
* **Profile Photo (Optional):** A photo you may add to personalize the interface.

**We explicitly state that** we do not request or store your name, email, age, gender, height, or weight.

### 2.2 Anonymous Technical Data for App Performance

To ensure stable operation and troubleshoot issues, we may collect anonymized technical data through standard industry services such as Firebase Crashlytics. This may include:

* **Crash Logs and Diagnostic Data:** Anonymous crash reports that help us identify why the app failed.
* **Device Information:** Device model and operating system version, which help us understand if issues are tied to specific device types.

This technical data is never linked with your personal nutrition data.

## 3. Purpose of Information Use

* **Data Stored on Your Device:** Used only to provide the app’s basic functionality (calorie counter, daily tracking, reporting, etc.). We do not process this data for any other purpose beyond displaying it back to you in graphs and lists.

* **Anonymous Technical Data:** Used solely to detect crashes, resolve performance issues, and improve the overall user experience.

## 4. Data Sharing

* Since we do not store your personal nutrition data on our servers, there is no data to share with third parties.

* Anonymous crash reports are processed by our service provider, Google (Firebase), to analyze issues.

## 5. Data Security and Retention

The security of your personal nutrition data depends on your device’s security, as this data never leaves your device. All information remains stored until you delete it within the app or uninstall the application.

## 6. Your Right to Delete Data

You have full control over your data. To permanently delete all records:

1. Go to the "Settings" menu inside the app.
2. Use the "Delete All Data" option to immediately erase your records.

Alternatively, you can clear the app’s data from your phone’s system settings to remove all information permanently.

## 7. Contact

For any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact us:

* **Email:** \[ertekin.developer@gmail.com]

## 8. Changes

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
